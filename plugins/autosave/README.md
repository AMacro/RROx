The **RROx Autosave plugin** allows you to enable periodic autosaves to one or more save game slots. When configuring multiple slots, the plugin will cycle through them.

The autosave plugin also offers the ability to save to 3 special backup slots that cannot be accessed in game, but that will be stored in the save game folder under the file names `backup1.sav`, `backup2.sav` and `backup3.sav`.

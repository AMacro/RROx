# Settings

## Map Background

The Map background can be customized. Two high resolution backgrounds are available that are highly detailled when zooming all the way in. It is also possible to choose one of the community created backgrounds, or to choose the default in-game map image.

## Colors

Every color that is used on the map can be customized under the colors settings menu. This includes the color scheme for all locomotives and freight cars, as well as all other map elements like tracks, grade, bridges, and switches.

It is not possible to customize the images used for the industries, water towers, firewood depots and sandhouses.

## Minimap

It is possible to enable the minimap under the minimap settings. **The minimap will only show if the game overlay is enabled under the `Overlay` settings**.
